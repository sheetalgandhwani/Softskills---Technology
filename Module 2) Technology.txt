Q-3) Share your approach to continuous learning and professional development.

    Continuous learning is the ongoing expansion of knowledge and skill sets. In the context of professional development in the workplace, it's about developing new skills and knowledge, while also reinforcing what has been previously learned.

The definition of continuous learning is broad -- it can be formal or informal and structured or unstructured in nature. Activities can include taking a formal course, observing more experienced employees, asking for assistance with an unfamiliar topic, exploring new and alternative work methods, studying, having casual conversations and practicing the use of a skill.

Daily habits and practices form the foundation of continuous learning. This type of learning works through any means of knowledge intake and can continue as lifelong learning.
